**Dummy Coordination Conversion (DCC) Application - Requirements Specification**

**Overview:**
The Dummy Coordination Conversion (DCC) application is designed to facilitate the management, conversion, and persistence of coordinate groups. The application supports both Cartesian and polar coordinate systems, providing functionality to convert between the two and store/retrieve/manage coordinate data. The frontend will be developed using Java with the Swing framework, while the database for storing coordinate groups will use MySQL, with a TCP/IP connection to handle data persistence.

### **Functional Requirements:**

1. **Creation of a Coordinate Group:**
   - Users can create a coordinate group consisting of two coordinate pairs: one in Cartesian format and its corresponding one in polar format.
   - The user will input the coordinates for one type (Cartesian or polar), and the system will automatically calculate and generate the other type.
   - The coordinate group will consist of:
     - Cartesian: (x, y)
     - Polar: (r, θ)

2. **Saving (Persisting) a Coordinate Group:**
   - The application will allow users to save coordinate groups into a persistent storage system (MySQL database).
   - Each saved coordinate group will be assigned:
     - A unique integer identifier (auto-generated by the system).
     - A user-defined string label for easy identification.
     - A automatically-assigned timestamp indicating the creation time

3. **Retrieval (Read Operations):**
   - The application will support the retrieval of coordinate groups:
     - **By label:** Users can search for a specific coordinate group using its string label.
     - **All groups:** Users can retrieve and view all stored coordinate groups at once.

4. **Modification of a Coordinate Group:**
   - Users will be able to select a coordinate group, modify its details (Cartesian or polar coordinates, label), and save the updated version back to the database.

5. **Deletion of a Coordinate Group:**
   - Users can delete a coordinate group from the database.

### **Non-functional Requirements:**

1. **Frontend:**
   - The user interface will be developed using Java and the Swing framework, providing a simple and user-friendly interface for interaction with the system.

2. **Database Management System (DBMS):**
   - Data persistence will be managed using a MySQL database.
   - The system will establish a connection to the database via TCP/IP to allow CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on coordinate groups.
